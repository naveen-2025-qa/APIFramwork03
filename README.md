# API Automation Framework using RestAssured, TestNG & SQL

A robust automation framework that validates CRUD operations for REST APIs using **TestNG** and **RestAssured**, with fully **database-driven test data**, elegant **ExtentReports integration**, and seamless **CI/CD execution via GitHub Actions**.

---

## Overview

This project streamlines REST API testing through an object-oriented and reusable design, leveraging Java, Maven, TestNG, and RestAssured. It supports data-driven validation by ingesting test input directly from a SQL database and outputs detailed test execution results via ExtentReports. CI/CD hooks using GitHub Actions ensure real-time feedback and scalable deployment-ready testing.
